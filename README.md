# Markov-Simulation-of-supermarket-customer-behaviour
Spiced project: with Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain chain simulate customer behaviour in a supermarket

In this project the following task will be performed:

1 Based on historical data, calculate the transition probablity of customers in a supermarket

2 define the customer Class and Supermarket Class





3 perform simulation of the customer behaviour in a supermarket.
