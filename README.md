# Markov-Simulation-of-supermarket-customer-behaviour
Spiced project: with Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain chain simulate customer behaviour in a supermarket



In this project the following task will be performed:

1 Based on historical data, calculate the transition probablity of customers in a supermarket

2 define the customer Class and Supermarket Class

3 perform simulation of the customer behaviour in a supermarket.


This is a group project which is under working. Thanks to group members: Ren√© Kuhn, Clemens Reichelt, specially thanks to Jinglin Li and teacher Kristian Rother. We learned many basic ideas from Jinglin's code which was reviewed by Kristian.
